# INFO3200ESA3

Project Name: Circuit Share
Planned Release: End of April 2025

Purpose: To foster and encourage a network of electric vehicle owners to connect by allowing users to "rent out" their EV chargers for decided upon rates. This is all
with the intention of reducing charger access issues for EV drivers, who are often going out of their way or having to wait in line if they are running low on battery.

Or it could act as a simple side gig, even if you don't have an electric vehicle!

How to run:

1. Open up the Visual Studio Project
2. Navigate to Debug > Start without Debugging

License & Reasoning:

I went simple with the MIT License. I am always for continuous improvement in tech and learning from others because it keeps competition high, so I don't mind if anyone
makes something similar, as long as it isn't just the direct source code. In fact, there are already companies/apps like this existing in other countries/cities, 
we just didn't realize until after our initial discussion. It likely wouldn't have a hugely negative impact as it would be impractical for more than one online service 
of this type to exist in the same city (There really just isn't a market big enough for it yet)
